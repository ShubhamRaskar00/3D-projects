# 3D Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the 3D Projects repository! This project showcases a collection of 3D models, scenes, and assets developed for various purposes including games, simulations, and virtual reality environments. Each model is carefully designed to ensure high-quality visuals and optimal performance.

## Features

- **High-Quality 3D Models:** Includes detailed and optimized 3D models such as cars, buildings, and environments.
- **Realistic Textures:** All models are equipped with realistic textures to enhance visual fidelity.
- **Multiple Formats:** Models are available in commonly used formats like `.glb`, `.obj`, and `.fbx` for easy integration into different platforms.
- **Ready for Integration:** Designed for easy integration into game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, or any other 3D application.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamRaskar00/3D-projects.git
   ```

2. **Install Git LFS:**
   This project uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage large files. Ensure that Git LFS is installed on your system.
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

3. **Download the Models:**
   After cloning, the large files will be downloaded via Git LFS automatically.

4. **Import into Your Project:**
   - For Unity: Drag and drop the `.glb` or `.fbx` files into your Unity project.
   - For Unreal Engine: Import the models directly using Unreal’s content browser.

## Dependencies

- **3D Software:** Models were created using Blender, and optimized for game engines.
- **Git LFS:** Used for managing large files in this repository.
